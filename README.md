# Superstore Sales Dashboard (Power BI)


---

## Purpose / Project Goal

The goal of this project is to analyze **Superstore Sales Performance** across multiple dimensions — regions, countries, product categories, and sub-categories — to identify profitable areas, reveal sales trends, and surface opportunities for business improvement. The dashboard consolidates key performance indicators and interactive visuals so business stakeholders can quickly spot revenue drivers, understand margin performance, and prioritize corrective or growth actions.

## Business / Problem Statement

The company seeks to **maximize profitability and optimize its sales strategy** by answering the following business questions:

* **Which categories and sub-categories contribute the most to revenue and profit?**
* **How are sales and profit distributed across countries and regions?**
* **What is the effect of units sold and discounting policies on overall margins?**
* **Which products, segments, or regions are underperforming and need corrective action?**

By addressing these questions, the dashboard helps leadership allocate marketing and operations resources more effectively, refine discount strategies, and focus product or regional initiatives that will increase long-term profitability.

## What I Did

1. **Connected & prepared the dataset**: Imported the Superstore dataset (Excel/CSV) into Power BI and validated schema & types.
2. **Data cleaning & transformation**: Handled missing values, standardized categorical labels, and created calculated measures (Total Sales, Profit, Quantity, Discount) using Power Query and DAX.
3. **Built interactive visuals**: Designed charts including a line chart (Sales by Quantity), donut chart (Sales by Category), bar charts (Profit by Country, Sales by Sub-Category), and KPI cards for quick metrics.
4. **Added slicers for exploration**: Implemented slicers for Region, Segment, Ship Mode, and State to enable on-the-fly filtering and deeper analysis.
5. **Dashboard design & layout**: Arranged KPIs, trend visuals, and detailed breakdowns for an at-a-glance view that supports strategic and tactical decision-making.

## Key Insights

* **Total Performance:** Total Sales ≈ $4M; Profit ≈ $436K from ~41K units sold.
* **Category concentration:** Technology and Office Supplies account for the largest share of sales, followed by Furniture.
* **Top sub-categories:** Chairs, Bookcases, and Copiers are major revenue contributors.
* **Geography:** China, Australia, and Japan show strong profitability; some markets (e.g., Pakistan, Bangladesh) show losses and warrant attention.
* **Quantity trends:** Highest sales density at smaller order sizes (2–5 units). Orders with larger quantities (>8) show a decline in total sales frequency.
* **Discount effects:** Volume of discounts appears to impact margins — review discounting by sub-category to avoid margin erosion.
